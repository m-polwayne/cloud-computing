# cloud-computing
The impact of cloud computing on businesses across industries cannot be overstated. It has revolutionized the way organizations operate, offering essential features like on-demand access to computing power and storage, virtually unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models

The five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are:

On-Demand Self-Service
Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly. These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services. The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.

Broad Network Access
Services are available across the network from commonly available clients. Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.

Resource Pooling
The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer. CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis. The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located. The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed. The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.

Rapid Elasticity
Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption. This process may be automatic or manual. Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed. In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year. For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others. With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources. Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.

Measured Service
Metering of resources is monitored, controlled, and billable. CSPs meter the utilization of their resources. This metering permits more efficient and dynamic resource allocation. It also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exactly the quantity of resources consumed.

Cloud Computing Ecosystem - It’s important to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market. This ecosystem consists of three categories of players:

Consumers of Services
These are the everyday end-users (like yourself or your colleagues) that use cloud services in their day-to-day business activities. They often may have little understanding of where the service resides or how it is designed; they simply need the capabilities to get the job done. Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud

Provider of Services
These cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to applications and tools.
Examples of prominent providers:Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud.

Provider of Services
These cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to 
applications and tools.

Designer of Services
These companies build applications and tools. Often services are intended to work within a specific cloud ecosystem or can augment a packaged cloud application. 

Here are some companies that specialise in designing and implementing cloud technologies: accenture, deloitte, capgemini, IBM, PwC etc.\

Understanding Cloud Concepts

Cloud computing is a method of providing shared computing resources, including applications, computing, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms as well as business processes. Cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use by providing standardization and automation.

Standardization is the implementation of services using a consistent approach supported by a set of consistent interfaces. Likewise, the cloud generally requires that processes be implemented through the use of automation.

Automation is a process that’s triggered based on business rules, resource availability, and security demands. Automation is required to support a self-service provisioning model. To promote efficiency, automation can ensure that after a provisioned service is no longer needed, it is returned to the resource pool. This type of rules-based automation can help with capacity planning and overall workload management.

Understanding Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud Components and Clients
There are three main components in a cloud services solution. The first component is the client platform from which the cloud services are being accessed. The second is the data center where the cloud services are being hosted. The final component is the network connection between those two points.

Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments

The public cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by a third party for use by other companies or individuals. CSPs offer public cloud services to virtually any customer. Customers use a subscription model to pay for access.  

The Private Cloud

A private cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for the use of its employees, partners, or customers. A private cloud can be created and managed by a third party for the exclusive use of one enterprise.  The organization retains complete control of the cloud deployment but can leverage the advantages of cloud technologies. This is especially viable for very large enterprises. The private cloud is a highly controlled environment not open for public consumption. Thus, a private cloud sits behind a firewall. The private cloud is highly automated with a focus on governance, security, and compliance.

The Hybrid and Multicloud Model

A hybrid I is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services where the two cloud environments work together to solve business problems. The goal is to create a hybrid cloud environment that can combine services and data from a variety of cloud models to create a unified, automated, and well-managed computing environment. In a well-orchestrated hybrid cloud environment, end-users won’t think about whether they are using on-premises or cloud services — it will all just be a technology service.

Cloud Within a Cloud (Virtual Private Cloud)

Also known as a virtual private cloud (VPC), the concept of cloud within a cloud means a public CSP hosts your organization’s cloud services in an isolated segment, separated from any resources shared with other companies. While your cloud services exist within a public cloud, those resources are private and unshared. Your organization takes full administrative responsibility.

Multitenancy

This is the concept behind public cloud deployments. Multiple consumers, known as tenants, share computing resources owned and managed by the CSP. This is the opposite idea from a VPC deployment. It is multitenancy that provides the cost benefits behind shared resource utilization.

Multi-cloud

There are many multi-cloud variations, but some of the most common are combinations of cloud services spread among two or more public CSPs (such as AWS and Azure) as well as on a private cloud infrastructure. Multi-cloud deployments reduce reliance on a single vendor, provide greater service flexibility and choice, permit improved geographic control of data, and help manage disaster mitigation.

Cloud Delivery Models

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  The hardware infrastructure is provided to the consumer. The consumer assumes responsibility for all layers above that hardware. The CSP manages hardware failures, firmware updates, device drivers, and hardware compatibility. The consumer installs and manages the operating system on top of the hardware as well as any services and applications that run above that operating system.
Platform as a Service (PaaS):  The service structure is provided by the CSP. It is up to the consumer to populate that structure, manage it on a day-to-day basis, and assume responsibility for the content. Support for the hardware, as well as the service platform that hosts the content, is offloaded to the CSP.
Software as a Service (SaaS):  The consumer is being provided with the direct use of the software. Responsibility for the hardware where that software runs, the operating system upon which it runs, and the installation and patching of the software itself are all offloaded to the CSP.
