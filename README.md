# cloud-computing
The impact of cloud computing on businesses across industries cannot be overstated. It has revolutionized the way organizations operate, offering essential features like on-demand access to computing power and storage, virtually unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models

The five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are:

On-Demand Self-Service
Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly. These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services. The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.

Broad Network Access
Services are available across the network from commonly available clients. Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.

Resource Pooling
The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer. CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis. The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located. The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed. The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.

Rapid Elasticity
Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption. This process may be automatic or manual. Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed. In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year. For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others. With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources. Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.

Measured Service
Metering of resources is monitored, controlled, and billable. CSPs meter the utilization of their resources. This metering permits more efficient and dynamic resource allocation. It also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exactly the quantity of resources consumed.

Cloud Computing Ecosystem - It’s important to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market. This ecosystem consists of three categories of players:

Consumers of Services
These are the everyday end-users (like yourself or your colleagues) that use cloud services in their day-to-day business activities. They often may have little understanding of where the service resides or how it is designed; they simply need the capabilities to get the job done. Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud

Provider of Services
These cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to applications and tools.
Examples of prominent providers:Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud.

Provider of Services
These cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to 
applications and tools.

Designer of Services
These companies build applications and tools. Often services are intended to work within a specific cloud ecosystem or can augment a packaged cloud application. 

Here are some companies that specialise in designing and implementing cloud technologies: accenture, deloitte, capgemini, IBM, PwC etc.\

Understanding Cloud Concepts

Cloud computing is a method of providing shared computing resources, including applications, computing, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms as well as business processes. Cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use by providing standardization and automation.

Standardization is the implementation of services using a consistent approach supported by a set of consistent interfaces. Likewise, the cloud generally requires that processes be implemented through the use of automation.

Automation is a process that’s triggered based on business rules, resource availability, and security demands. Automation is required to support a self-service provisioning model. To promote efficiency, automation can ensure that after a provisioned service is no longer needed, it is returned to the resource pool. This type of rules-based automation can help with capacity planning and overall workload management.

Understanding Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud Components and Clients
There are three main components in a cloud services solution. The first component is the client platform from which the cloud services are being accessed. The second is the data center where the cloud services are being hosted. The final component is the network connection between those two points.

Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments

The public cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by a third party for use by other companies or individuals. CSPs offer public cloud services to virtually any customer. Customers use a subscription model to pay for access.  

The Private Cloud

A private cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for the use of its employees, partners, or customers. A private cloud can be created and managed by a third party for the exclusive use of one enterprise.  The organization retains complete control of the cloud deployment but can leverage the advantages of cloud technologies. This is especially viable for very large enterprises. The private cloud is a highly controlled environment not open for public consumption. Thus, a private cloud sits behind a firewall. The private cloud is highly automated with a focus on governance, security, and compliance.

The Hybrid and Multicloud Model

A hybrid I is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services where the two cloud environments work together to solve business problems. The goal is to create a hybrid cloud environment that can combine services and data from a variety of cloud models to create a unified, automated, and well-managed computing environment. In a well-orchestrated hybrid cloud environment, end-users won’t think about whether they are using on-premises or cloud services — it will all just be a technology service.

Cloud Within a Cloud (Virtual Private Cloud)

Also known as a virtual private cloud (VPC), the concept of cloud within a cloud means a public CSP hosts your organization’s cloud services in an isolated segment, separated from any resources shared with other companies. While your cloud services exist within a public cloud, those resources are private and unshared. Your organization takes full administrative responsibility.

Multitenancy

This is the concept behind public cloud deployments. Multiple consumers, known as tenants, share computing resources owned and managed by the CSP. This is the opposite idea from a VPC deployment. It is multitenancy that provides the cost benefits behind shared resource utilization.

Multi-cloud

There are many multi-cloud variations, but some of the most common are combinations of cloud services spread among two or more public CSPs (such as AWS and Azure) as well as on a private cloud infrastructure. Multi-cloud deployments reduce reliance on a single vendor, provide greater service flexibility and choice, permit improved geographic control of data, and help manage disaster mitigation.

Cloud Delivery Models

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  The hardware infrastructure is provided to the consumer. The consumer assumes responsibility for all layers above that hardware. The CSP manages hardware failures, firmware updates, device drivers, and hardware compatibility. The consumer installs and manages the operating system on top of the hardware as well as any services and applications that run above that operating system.
Platform as a Service (PaaS):  The service structure is provided by the CSP. It is up to the consumer to populate that structure, manage it on a day-to-day basis, and assume responsibility for the content. Support for the hardware, as well as the service platform that hosts the content, is offloaded to the CSP.
Software as a Service (SaaS):  The consumer is being provided with the direct use of the software. Responsibility for the hardware where that software runs, the operating system upon which it runs, and the installation and patching of the software itself are all offloaded to the CSP.

Embracing the Business Imperative
Understanding IT Transformation
With the rise of commercial cloud computing vendors and services, the role of IT is changing dramatically. While the IT organization in the past had total control of computing resources, now IT is tasked with providing oversight, management, and vetting of options. IT must be able to provide the business with ways to integrate processes and data across silos. The security organization is also responsible for ensuring security and compliance.

Rethinking the Type of Constituents Your Cloud Serves

Cloud consumers:  The individuals and groups within your business unit that use different types of cloud services to get a task accomplished. A cloud consumer could be a developer using computing services from a public cloud.
Direct customers:  Users who often take advantage of services that your business has created within a cloud environment. End users of your service have no idea that you are using a public or private cloud. As far as the users are concerned, they are interacting directly with your services and value.
Cloud service provider:  Commercial vendors or companies that create their own capabilities. Commercial vendors sell their services to cloud consumers. In contrast, a company might decide to become an internal cloud service provider to its own employees, partners, and customers — either as an internal service or as a profit center. These providers also create applications or services for these environments.

Optimizing SaaS Management
Once a business has set the ground rules for using SaaS within the organization and educated users on the best practices of using public SaaS applications, it can take additional steps to improve costs, productivity, and security. As use of SaaS applications expands through an enterprise, IT and security teams should review use of SaaS applications. Security should examine actual use to understand whether any practices are risking loss of the business’s intellectual property (IP), opening up connections that hackers can exploit or where other insecure activities can occur.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Every cloud resource comes with a contractual agreement, known as a service level agreement (SLA), that outlines what the provider is delivering, along with the customer’s responsibilities. The agreement should outline characteristics like availability, accuracy, response time, throughput, and security. These important traits are critical for selecting resources that will meet the performance requirements of the services or applications that will use them.

Managing a hybrid cloud environment
Businesses are increasingly leveraging a combination of public and private clouds. The combination of these resources provides the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and performance to their internal computing consumers.

What are Standards?
Standards are established common and repeatable practices that have been agreed to by a business or group. An open standard is one that is publicly and freely available, one that has been developed in a public context where anyone who is affected by the standard can contribute. An open standard assumes that experienced developers will contribute to the viability of the offering. Typically, different vendors, groups, and end users collaborate to develop standards based on the broad expertise of a large number of stakeholders. Organizations can leverage these standards as a common foundation and build on top of them.

Evolution of Standards

Standards have generally been established in four ways:

Multinational bodies:  Treaties or other similar international legal agreements typically govern these bodies. These groups generally have long procedures and red tape before an agreement is reached. Members may be diplomats instead of technical experts. The International Organization for Standards (ISO) is one such group and is comprised of representatives from countries all over the world. ISO has developed more than 17,500 standards covering many subject areas, and new standards are developed every year.
Industry consortiums:  A consortium is typically an organized group dedicated to developing standards for a specific industry requirement. Even though the members may be competitors, they know that coming together will help everyone. These groups are often more streamlined and agile than international bodies and often directly engage technical experts in the process. The Apache Group, The Open Group, World Wide Web Consortium, and OASIS are some examples of industry consortiums.
An ad hoc group:  Ad hoc groups are self-organized and governed. These groups are often built around open-source initiatives. They can be a loose body that discusses their matters through an Internet message board, or they may be more formally organized. These groups have even fewer processes than industry consortiums and are therefore able to quickly adapt and change as technology moves. A downside to the lower process overhead is that when difficult decisions need to be made or problems arise, getting to the correct solution and reaching a consensus may be difficult or impossible.
De facto standards:  A de facto standard emerges when an approach or product is used so extensively used that it becomes a standard. The important distinction is that a de facto standard is not created by a specific body or organization, but instead develops through practice. Often, de facto standards emerge when industry best practices converge.

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), standards can be categorized based on their level of maturity:
None
Under development
Approved
A reference
Market accepted (in widespread use)
Retired

For a standard to truly succeed, it needs to be:
Broadly recognized and adopted by vendors,
Broadly adopted and demanded by consumers,
Open source.

 areas, where standards are being broadly developed, include the following:
Interoperability
Portability
Security

Interoperability
Interoperability is the ability for independent systems to work together and/or share information. One of the most important aspects of interoperability is the ability to enable applications to exchange data in a multicloud or on-premises data centre. It also includes independent cloud deployments working together, such as public clouds from different vendors or interoperability between a private cloud and an external public cloud

Portability
Portability enables you to take applications, data, or instances running on one vendor’s system and deploy it on another vendor’s implementation. For example, you may want to move your data or application from one cloud environment to another. Or you may want to use IaaS services to gain additional compute power from a variety of public clouds during peak demand times or when on-premises resources are otherwise tied up

Security
Cloud security is a significant concern and one must make sure that the right controls, procedures, and technology are in place to protect your corporate assets. Your organization has invested a great deal internally to protect your assets, and it is reasonable to assume that your cloud provider will do the same. A sound security strategy is especially true in a hybrid environment where your private cloud or data centre has touchpoints with public cloud services.
Cloud security standards are a set of processes, policies, and best practices that ensure the proper controls are placed over an environment to prevent application, information, identity, and access issues (to name a few).

Authentication and authorization: Several standards are in use to verify the identity of a person or computer.
Security monitoring and incident response: Some standards have been approved to handle security monitoring and incident response, including the best practices developed by NIST in the NIST SP 800-61Rev. 2 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data: A number of standards that have been on the market for some time deal with encryption of data, keys, and data transport. These standards include the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), developed by OASIS, 
Security policy management: These standards set forth best practices and procedures for implementing policies around security. FIPS 200: Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems developed by NIST is an example of this kind of standard.

The Impact of Standards on the Multicloud
Standards let you do the following:

Move your infrastructure or applications from one cloud provider to another. With cloud standards across clouds, you do not have to rewrite code. In a multicloud world, where you may have part of the resources associated with an application on your own premises and part with a cloud provider, this capability is important because it enables your organization to be more flexible about where your resources may be located.
Prevent vendor lock-in. Lock-in occurs when you are so entrenched with a particular provider and its interfaces that moving to another provider is too costly. Removing barriers to lock-in increases your choices.
Integrate applications more easily between your on-premises data center and private and public cloud environments. Face it; integrating your assets across multiple environments can be time-consuming and costly if every cloud provider has a proprietary model. Standards help to make integration easier and eliminate many common barriers.
